Description: The assessr package makes it easy for instructors to
    generate and assess randomized R assignments. Assignments are
    RMarkdown 'stub' files that are distributed to students. Students
    fill in code and return the files to the instructor for
    assessment. The instructor runs automated assessment on the files
    and then uses a shiny app to moderate the results. Finally, HTML
    feedback files are generated that can be distributed to students.
Depends: R (>= 3.4.2)
