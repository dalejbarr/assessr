\description{
Test difference in model (fixed effects) terms
}
\details{
See whether two models differ in fixed effects terms. This can be tricky because interaction terms that are ordered differently (\code{x:y} and \code{y:x}) should be treated as identical. Any interactions will always be returned sorted in alphabetical order.
